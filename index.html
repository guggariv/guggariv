              <p>Nike’s Global Store System (GSS) comprises of various applications including Point of Sale (POS) and Inventory Management (IM). The Point of Sale system comprises of the Register application that is used by the store cashier to perform sale transactions at the store check-out, and the Back-office application that helps managing the Start of day, End of day and Cash management activities related to store operations. The Inventory management application runs on the Back-Office system as well as the Hand-Held Terminal (HHT) device used by the store personnel. The Inventory application is primarily used to receive products and manage it in store and inventory adjustment, stock on hand, Physical Inventory, and auditing items in bin wise. The global configuration is based on the global business processes that align the four regions (US, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Americas) and will be the baseline configuration implemented globally. Few functional requirements are modified/added to migrate existing Nike US configuration of Store 6.1 based on the global business processes to a Global configuration of NSB Store 6.2. Additional business requirements and legal or statutory requirements in the following areas that cause the EMEA region to branch off from the global baser>
• Back Office / Cash Managementr>
• Point of Sale (POS)r>
• Inventory Management

              <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
              <p>Today, the majority of the strategic reporting needs in US retail are satisfied by the Essbase application. Essbase consolidates actual data from Island Pacific, plan data from Arthur and other sources to generate reports. Nike retail is currently implementing a global merchandise planning system (SAS) to replace the legacy system (Arthur). The Arthur to Essbase link will be broken once SAS goes live in January 2009. As a result, all Essbase reports that are built with Arthur Plan information will also be broken. Without these reports, the retail leadership team will not be able to manage performance and react to marketing conditions against a complete view of information. The SAS system will be implemented based on a 4-5-4 calendar with week as the lowest level of time for all plans. These plans need to be converted to Julian calendar to align with business processes and reporting needs for Retail Finance and Nike wholesale. The main purpose of Retail Data Mart– Phase I project is to build a reporting and analytics solution to replace the following broken Essbase reporting capabilities for US retail once Retail Data Mart goes live in Jan 2009.<br>
• Daily Sell Through report<br>
• Calendar report<br>
• STATS report<br>
• RLT Recap report<br>
• Sales & Margin report<br>
• Actual vs Plan Sales Performance report<br>
• Ad hoc analytics against actual and plan sales, receipts, and inventory Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This new tables, along with the existing tables that provide usage and offer information would constitute the data source of the proposed Pricing Calculator, PM interface would have the provision to view/modify the deals created by the RM, filter them based on various criteria, approve or reject the deals, and bulk price a set of subscribers under a plan. Upon approval of the pricing provided by the RM the Admin interface would have provisions to provide the rights and information required to calculate the pricing.

              <p>i.Galaxy Anaesthesia is a total anaesthetic solution for capturing all anaesthetic-related data. It allows you to record, store and print real-time data from physiological monitoring apparatus during an anaesthetic to a laptop computer where it is displayed on the screen. In addition, you can record information that is not generated automatically such as the administration of drugs and fluids and clinical observations. The anaesthetic record is conceptualized as a series of discrete events. <br>a. Numerical Events - Eg: the recording of BP/HR every minutev
b. Text Events - Eg: a note recording a critical incident<br>
c. Drug/Fluid Events - Eg: giving an induction dose of propofol.<br>
All of this time-dependent information can be stored and displayed easily with the minimum of human intervention. Contingencies are included at many levels to take account of malfunctioning equipment and measurements which are out of context or artifactual.
